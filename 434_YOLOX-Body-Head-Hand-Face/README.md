Lightweight human detection model generated using a high-quality human dataset. I annotated all the data by myself. Extreme resistance to blur and occlusion. In addition, the recognition rate at short, medium, and long distances has been greatly enhanced. The camera's resistance to darkness and halation has been greatly improved.

`Head` does not mean `Face`. Thus, the entire head is detected rather than a narrow region of the face. This makes it possible to detect all 360Â° head orientations.

The advantage of being able to detect hands with high accuracy is that it makes it possible to detect key points on the fingers as correctly as possible. The video below is processed by converting the MediaPipe tflite file to ONNX, so the performance of keypoint detection is not very high. It is assumed that information can be acquired quite robustly when combined with a highly accurate keypoint detection model focused on the hand region. It would be realistic to use the distance in the Z direction, which represents depth, in combination with physical information such as ToF, rather than relying on model estimation. To obtain as accurate a three-dimensional value as possible, including depth, sparse positional information on a two-dimensional plane, such as skeletal detection, is likely to break down the algorithm. This has the advantage that unstable depths can be easily corrected by a simple algorithm by capturing each part of the body in planes, as a countermeasure to the phenomenon that when information acquired from a depth camera (ToF or stereo camera parallax measurement) is used at any one point, the values are affected by noise and become unstable due to environmental noise.

The method of detecting 133 skeletal keypoints at once gives the impression that the process is very heavy because it requires batch or loop processing to calculate heat maps for multiple human bounding boxes detected by the object detection model. I also feel that the computational cost is high because complex affine transformations and other coordinate transformation processes must be performed on large areas of the entire body. However, this is not my negative view of a model that detects 133 keypoints, only that it is computationally expensive to run on an unpowered edge device.

## 1. Dataset
  - COCO-Hand (14,667 Images, 66,903 labels, All re-annotated manually)
  - http://vision.cs.stonybrook.edu/~supreeth/COCO-Hand.zip
  - I am adding my own enhancement data to COCO-Hand and re-annotating all images. In other words, only COCO images were cited and no annotation data were cited.
  - I have no plans to publish my own dataset.

- Post-Process

  Because I add my own post-processing to the end of the model, which can be inferred by TensorRT, CUDA, and CPU, the benchmarked inference speed is the end-to-end processing speed including all pre-processing and post-processing. EfficientNMS in TensorRT is very slow and should be offloaded to the CPU.

  - NMS default parameter

    |param|value|note|
    |:-|-:|:-|
    |max_output_boxes_per_class|20|Maximum number of outputs per class of one type. `20` indicates that the maximum number of people detected is `20`, the maximum number of heads detected is `20`, and the maximum number of hands detected is `20`. The larger the number, the more people can be detected, but the inference speed slows down slightly due to the larger overhead of NMS processing by the CPU. In addition, as the number of elements in the final output tensor increases, the amount of information transferred between hardware increases, resulting in higher transfer costs on the hardware circuit. Therefore, it would be desirable to set the numerical size to the minimum necessary.|
    |iou_threshold|0.40|A value indicating the percentage of occlusion allowed for multiple bounding boxes of the same class. `0.40` is excluded from the detection results if, for example, two bounding boxes overlap in more than 41% of the area. The smaller the value, the more occlusion is tolerated, but over-detection may increase.|
    |score_threshold|0.25|Bounding box confidence threshold. Specify in the range of `0.00` to `1.00`. The larger the value, the stricter the filtering and the lower the NMS processing load, but in exchange, all but bounding boxes with high confidence values are excluded from detection. This is a parameter that has a very large percentage impact on NMS overhead.|

    For example,
    ```bash
    pip install onnxsim==0.4.33 \
    && pip install -U simple-onnx-processing-tools \
    && pip install -U onnx \
    && python -m pip install -U onnx_graphsurgeon \
        --index-url https://pypi.ngc.nvidia.com

    ### max_output_boxes_per_class
    ### Example of changing the maximum number of detections per class to 100.
    sam4onnx \
    --op_name main01_nonmaxsuppression11 \
    --input_onnx_file_path yolox_s_body_head_hand_post_0299_0.4983_1x3x256x320.onnx \
    --output_onnx_file_path yolox_s_body_head_hand_post_0299_0.4983_1x3x256x320.onnx \
    --input_constants main01_max_output_boxes_per_class int64 [100]

    ### iou_threshold
    ### Example of changing the allowable area of occlusion to 20%.
    sam4onnx \
    --op_name main01_nonmaxsuppression11 \
    --input_onnx_file_path yolox_s_body_head_hand_post_0299_0.4983_1x3x256x320.onnx \
    --output_onnx_file_path yolox_s_body_head_hand_post_0299_0.4983_1x3x256x320.onnx \
    --input_constants main01_iou_threshold float32 [0.20]

    ### score_threshold
    ### Example of changing the bounding box score threshold to 15%.
    sam4onnx \
    --op_name main01_nonmaxsuppression11 \
    --input_onnx_file_path yolox_s_body_head_hand_post_0299_0.4983_1x3x256x320.onnx \
    --output_onnx_file_path yolox_s_body_head_hand_post_0299_0.4983_1x3x256x320.onnx \

  - Post-processing structure

    PyTorch alone cannot generate this post-processing.

- INT8 quantization ([TexasInstruments/YOLOX-ti-lite](https://github.com/TexasInstruments/edgeai-yolox))

  In my experience, YOLOX has a very large accuracy degradation during quantization due to its structure. The reasons for this and the workaround are examined in detail by TexasInstruments. I have summarized the main points below on how to minimize accuracy degradation during quantization through my own practice. I just put into practice what TexasInstruments suggested, but the degrade in accuracy during quantization was extremely small. Note, however, that the results of the Float16 mixed-precision training before quantization are significantly degraded in accuracy due to the change in activation function to `ReLU` and many other workarounds, as well as the completely different data sets being benchmarked.
