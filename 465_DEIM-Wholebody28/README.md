This model far surpasses the performance of existing CNNs in both inference speed and accuracy. I'm not particularly interested in comparing performance between architectures, so I don't cherry-pick any of the verification results. What is important is a balance between accuracy, speed, the number of output classes, and versatility of output values.

Lightweight human detection models generated on high-quality human data sets. It can detect objects with high accuracy and speed in a total of 28 classes: `Body`, `Adult`, `Child`, `Male`, `Female`, `Body_with_Wheelchair`, `Body_with_Crutches`, `Head`, `Front`, `Right_Front`, `Right_Side`, `Right_Back`, `Back`, `Left_Back`, `Left_Side`, `Left_Front`, `Face`, `Eye`, `Nose`, `Mouth`, `Ear`, `Shoulder`, `Elbow`, `Hand`, `Hand_Left`, `Hand_Right`, `Knee`, `Foot`. Even the classification problem is being attempted to be solved by object detection. There is no need to perform any complex affine transformations or other processing for pre-processing and post-processing of input images. In addition, the resistance to Motion Blur, Gaussian noise, contrast noise, backlighting, and halation is quite strong because it was trained only on images with added photometric noise for all images in the MS-COCO subset of the image set. In addition, about half of the image set was annotated by me with the aspect ratio of the original image substantially destroyed. I manually annotated all images in the dataset by myself. The model is intended to use real-world video for inference and has enhanced resistance to all kinds of noise. Probably stronger than any known model. However, the quality of the known data set and my data set are so different that an accurate comparison of accuracy is not possible.

The aim is to estimate head pose direction with minimal computational cost using only an object detection model, with an emphasis on practical aspects. The concept is significantly different from existing full-mesh type head direction estimation models, head direction estimation models with tweaked loss functions, and models that perform precise 360Â° 6D estimation. Capturing the features of every part of the body on a 2D surface makes it very easy to combine with other feature extraction processes.

Don't be ruled by the curse of mAP.

## 1. Dataset
  - COCO-Hand http://vision.cs.stonybrook.edu/~supreeth/COCO-Hand.zip
  - [CD-COCO: Complex Distorted COCO database for Scene-Context-Aware computer vision](https://github.com/aymanbegh/cd-coco)
  - I am adding my own enhancement data to COCO-Hand and re-annotating all images. In other words, only COCO images were cited and no annotation data were cited.
  - I have no plans to publish my own dataset.

## 2. Annotation

  The trick to annotation is to not miss a single object and not compromise on a single pixel. The ultimate methodology is to `try your best`.

  Please feel free to change the head direction label as you wish. There is no correlation between the model's behavior and the meaning of the label text.

  - Demonstration of models with built-in post-processing (Float32/Float16)
  - `score_threshold` is a very rough value set for testing purposes, so feel free to adjust it to your liking. The default threshold is probably too low.
  - There is a lot of information being rendered into the image, so if you want to compare performance with other models it is best to run the demo with `-dnm`, `-dgm`, `-dlr` and `-dhm`.

- Pre-Process

  To ensure fair benchmark comparisons with YOLOX, `BGR to RGB conversion processing` and `normalization by division by 255.0` are added to the model input section.
